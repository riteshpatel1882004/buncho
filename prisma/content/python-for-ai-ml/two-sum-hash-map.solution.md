```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))   # [0, 1]
```

One pass with a hash map: **O(n)** time, O(n) space. The brute-force double loop is O(n²).
